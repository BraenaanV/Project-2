# Project 2 - Task Assistant +

## Description
This app was made using node.js running in the integrated terminal of VSCode. The purpose of creating this was to design a way to make quick and readable README's.
The running app will prompt the user to input answers throughout a series of several questions. We now have the information required to construct a readme file. 
This app compiles the responses and formats them into a finished markdown file.

## User Story
